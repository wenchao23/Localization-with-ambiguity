# Localization-with-ambiguity

This function is the implementation of the [paper](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/21/4/1507), where the three ambiguous positions of a group of mobile sensors are given with offset of single anchor. 

Via these positions and offset, the positions of other sensors can be localized efficiently in a closed-form.
